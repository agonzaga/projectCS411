# projectCS411

<b> Proposal 1 </b>

Our proposal is to make use of IBM Watson’s Personality Insights service and let a user feed in a Facebook account’s posts to get a personality read of the facebook account. We intend to let the user store these requests so they can update the account’s personality and see if there were any changes since the last time they updated the account. These requests will be stored in our database. If it is easy, we intend on expanding the feature to Twitter as well.
