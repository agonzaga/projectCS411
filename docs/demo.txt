We decided to use Flask because our entire team was familiar with python and
some of us had used it before. For our API, we chose to just demo our twitter
API because our process is simple for Facebook. We take raw text from posts,
and then parse out any non speech text. Then, we will feed it into Watson.

We did not consider any other stacks because only 1 of us had used Javascript
before.
