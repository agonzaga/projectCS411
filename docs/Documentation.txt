For our cache, we used sequel Lite with our flask application to store the user
data. After an API is called, we will store text results into our database. For
tweets, we will store it into a table called Tweets, with two columns: Handle,
and tweet_body. For Facebook, the table called Facebook will store Facebook name
and text of posts. When the user exits, we will clear the cache.

We have yet to integrate the front end and the cache together, but we have
created the database.

Our ER diagram shows that there is no relationship between the tables.
