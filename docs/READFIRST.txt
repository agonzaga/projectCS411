During implementation of the project, we realized that Facebook would not allow us to use 
their API the way we wanted to. In order to access the user_posts field of their API, facebook
requires first that we get approved to use it. To submit a approval request, we would have
had to submit a screencast video on how the user will be using the app, how we plan on using
user_posts as useful data, and a Privacy Policy page for the user. 

Therefore, we decided to drop Facebook altogether in our project. Please ignore anything in the docs
folder that is related to Facebook.
